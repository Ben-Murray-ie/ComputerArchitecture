# Computer_Architecture

**Computer Architecture & Technology Convergence**

In this module, along with lectures on the history of computers and the trajectory of the industry going forward, we were tasked with creating and setting up an AWS instance and accessing it remotely using Putty to perform certain operations. Part of the project was to use Vim to create two bash scripts to familiarise ourselves with the terminal and Linux.

---

The first bash script generates a text file containing the outputs from several terminal commands on Linux, to demonstrate their purpose.

The second script generates math tables that can be interacted with by the user.

---

**Instructions:**

_Script 1:_

* Navigate to the script in the terminal and run (Linux), or use a terminal emulator such as CMDer (Windows).
* Output will be to a text file called benMurray.txt in the same directory as the script was run.

_Script 2:_

* Navigate to the script and run as above.
* User is prompted to choose an operator (+, -, *, / or ^).
* User is then prompted to choose a number between 1 and 15.
* Math table showing user selected operation and number is presented on screen, then program closes automatically.
